## 🚀 Overview

**Financial Portfolio Assistant** is a comprehensive Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed for traders and data enthusiasts. It bridges the gap between real-time market tracking, automated technical analysis, and intelligent alerting mechanisms.

Unlike simple trackers, this system leverages **Machine Learning** for trend forecasting and generates professional-grade **Excel reports** for offline analysis. It is built to run efficiently in the background, monitoring assets 24/7 and notifying the user via desktop alerts when specific market conditions are met.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🔔 Intelligent Alarm System (3-Layer Logic)
The system moves beyond simple price targets by offering three distinct monitoring algorithms:
* **Fixed Price Alarm:** Triggers when an asset crosses a specific price threshold (e.g., *Bitcoin > $100,000*).
* **Percentage Change Alarm:** Detects sudden volatility by monitoring percentage moves within a specific timeframe (e.g., *Price drops 5% in 1 hour*).
* **Period Extremum Alarm:** Monitors for breakout signals by triggering when the price exceeds the highest or lowest value of a user-defined period (e.g., *New 30-day High*).
* **Desktop Notifications:** Powered by `plyer`, alerts are delivered directly to the user's desktop environment.

### 2. 📑 Automated Financial Reporting
Generates detailed `.xlsx` reports using `xlsxwriter` for in-depth post-market analysis.
* **Summary Sheet:** Provides a snapshot of performance including Start/End Prices, Total Return, Volatility, and Min/Max values over the selected period.
* **Raw Data Sheet:** Archives historical OHLCV data alongside calculated technical indicators, formatted for easy integration with other analytical tools.

### 3. 🤖 ML-Powered Price Prediction
* **Trend Forecasting:** Utilizes `scikit-learn` to train regression models on historical data.
* **Predictive Analysis:** Forecases short-term price movements to support "Buy/Hold/Sell" decision-making processes.

### 4. 📊 Advanced Technical Analysis
* **Indicator Engine:** Powered by `pandas-ta`, the system calculates key metrics (RSI, SMA50 and SMA200; HV-21, HV-63 and HV-252) automatically.
* **Visualization:** Integrated `matplotlib` and `mplfinance` libraries allow for the generation of static charts and trend visualizations directly from the CLI.

### 5. 🔒 Security & Data Integrity
* **Secure Authentication:** User credentials and sensitive configurations are hashed and secured using `bcrypt`.
* **Data Handling:** Robust data manipulation using `pandas` and `numpy` ensures accuracy in financial calculations.
